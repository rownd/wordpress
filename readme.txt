Instantly turn visitors into users with Rownd's radically simple, user-centric authentication.

== Description ==

Rownd is a user authentication and account platform that helps you convert more visitors to your website into actual (paying) customers.

We're focused on passwordless sign-in that uses email and SMS as a means of distributing authentication links that allow users to verify
their email/phone after they've had the opportunity to explore your product or service.

When you install the Rownd plugin for WordPress, you'll bring our powerfully simple authentication and user account capabilities into
your website, blog, or ecommerce site.

Rownd integrates with the existing WordPress user management system, which means we're compatible with WooCommerce and many other
WordPress addons!

Whether you're accepting user signups already or want to start, Rownd makes it ultra-simple to get visitors and customers up and running quickly.
Easily trigger our sign-in dialog by setting some HTML data attributes in your code or writing some simple Javascript and we'll handle getting
your users verified and signed in using our unique, passwordless approach.

To get started, you'll need:
1. A free [Rownd account](https://app.rownd.io)
2. A Rownd app key

Once you install this plugin, drop your app key and secret into our settings and you'll be good to go!

Usage of this plugin is governed by Rownd's [terms of service](https://rownd.io/terms-and-conditions).

== Installation ==

**Automated installation**
Installation is free, quick, and easy. Just hit the "Install Now" button, activate the plugin, and add your Rownd app key and secret.

Manual alternatives
